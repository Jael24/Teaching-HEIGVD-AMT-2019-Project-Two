# Known Bugs

- The project isn't finished. Unfortunatly, we have not the time to finish everything. We lost a lot of time in making BDD tests with Cucumber working, and we finally don't success. Functional requirements are almost ok, except Traefik.
- The non-functional requirements are mostly not implement. We haven't test. And the docker-topologies works only with the first API (manage account).
